<h1>Using Doulos SIL webfonts</h1>

<p>The page demonstrates how to use the WOFF2 version of Doulos SIL for web pages, using a local copy of the .woff2 file in this archive. For more information on this technique - and how to use the normal TrueType version as a web font - see <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/webfonts">Using SIL Fonts on Web Pages</a>.</p>

<p>The body of this document is styled using an external stylesheet, with Doulos SIL set as the default font, and loaded directly as a WOFF2 file using the @font-face rule. If you're seeing a serif font here then it is working. Otherwise the text will be in a sans-serif or your browser default. This technique is supported in all modern browsers.</p>
	
<p>To see specifically how these techniques are specified in the CSS and HTML view the source to this page and the accompanying CSS file.</p>
