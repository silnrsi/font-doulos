Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions specifically regarding Doulos SIL:

#### *Why does the font have some Greek characters, but not all?*

Although Doulos SIL includes some Greek characters, it is not intended to provide general support for the Greek language. The Greek characters that are included are there to support various notational systems (linguistic, logical, mathematical). Other fonts, such as [Gentium](https://software.sil.org/gentium), provide complete Greek script support. 

#### *Will you add full Greek script support?*

We have no plans to do that. However the [OFL licensing](https://openfontlicense.org_web) allows anyone to add Greek support and freely distribute the font to others. It is even possible to [contribute that work back to the project](developer.md) and share it with others.

#### *Why doesn’t Doulos SIL have a full set of styles? Will you add them in the future?*

Our other fonts (Charis, Gentium, and Andika) are much better suited for most purposes and contain full sets of styles. Doulos SIL is provided for those who need a very basic font in the style of Times. We have no plans to add additional styles to Doulos SIL.

#### *Why is version 7 likely to be the last major version of Doulos SIL?*

There remain few, if any, uses for which Doulos SIL is a good font choice, and we want to focus future efforts into our other fonts.

#### *Is there a guide to the many versions of Doulos SIL and its variants?*

Yes! See the [Versions](versions.md) page.
