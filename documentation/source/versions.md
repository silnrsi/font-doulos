## Announcement list

If you would like stay informed of updates to Doulos SIL and other SIL fonts, please subscribe to the [SIL Font News Announcement List](https://groups.google.com/a/groups.sil.org/forum/#!forum/sil-font-news). For more information see [About](about.md).

Our font announcements are also available through X (formerly Twitter) [\@silfonts](https://x.com/silfonts).

## Current versions

The latest version of the font is always available from the [Doulos SIL download page](https://software.sil.org/doulos/download/) as a .zip archive for all major platforms.

Doulos SIL is also available through the [TypeTuner Web](https://typetunerweb.languagetechnology.org/ttw/fonts2go.cgi) service, which allows you to choose among the smart font features and download a font with those features preset. This enables them to work in many applications that do not fully support OpenType.

## Other Doulos SIL versions and variants

There are many font families based on the Doulos SIL design, as summarized in this table. Current versions are in **bold**. Additional information is provided in later sections.

Font Family | Versions | Status and use
----------- | -------- | ---------------------
**Doulos SIL**|**7.000**|**Current**—recommended for all uses and users
Doulos SIL|4.000–6.200|No longer recommended—please use current version
Doulos SIL Compact|4.106–6.200|Fonts with reduced default line spacing—no longer recommended
Doulos SIL Literacy|4.014–6.200|Literacy variants with alternate a and g forms—no longer recommended
Doulos SIL Literacy Comp|4.106–6.200|Compact literacy variants—no longer recommended
Doulos SIL Literacy AmArea|5.000–6.200|Literacy variants with AmArea features—no longer recommended
Doulos SIL *special variant*|5.000–6.200|Modified versions for special purposes (AmArea, Mali, Tat)—no longer recommended
Doulos SIL *region subset*|5.000|Subsets for particular regions (Afr, Am, APac, Cyr, CyrE, Eur, Phon, Viet)—no longer recommended

Versions prior to Doulos SIL v4.000 were named SIL Doulos and are no longer available.

There are also font families named ‘Doulos *something*’ that were created using [TypeTuner Web](https://scripts.sil.org/ttw/fonts2go.cgi). We have no record or archive of most of these ‘tuned’ fonts, but if you are desperate to find them contact us. We may be able to point you to the distributors of those that we know about.

### *Compact* versions

Doulos SIL version 7 does not have a *Compact* variant. Most users should use the version 7 font and adjust line spacing explicitly within the application if necessary. If your application does not allow control over line spacing, you can use the [version 6.200 Doulos SIL Compact font](https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/), which remains available. **If you need any of the new version 7 features or characters, but also need them supported in a compact version please [contact us](https://software.sil.org/doulos/about/contact/).**

### Special-purpose modified variants

[Modified versions of Doulos SIL version 6.200](https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/) are available that have been ‘tuned’ to turn on certain features by default. These are available for some regions and include *Literacy* versions. **These remain at version 6.200 and have not been updated to Doulos SIL version 7. If you need any of the new features or characters in this version, but also need them supported in the special-purpose modified fonts please [contact us](https://software.sil.org/doulos/about/contact/).**

### Version 5 subsets

In the past, special *subset* versions of Doulos SIL version 5 were created for specific uses. Those fonts still work and [remain available](https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/font-subsets/). These are limited versions of the fonts that support only the characters needed for a particular area or use. Subsets are available for Africa, Americas, Asia/Pacific, Europe/Eurasia, Vietnam, Phonetic, Cyrillic (Basic) and Cyrillic Extended. With the exception of the Phonetic font, the font subsets are intended for orthographic use only. We have not put anything in the other subsets for phonetic, transliteration, or transcription use. For those purposes, use the Phonetic subset. We do not intend to update these fonts, however they may still work. **We do not, however, recommend their use. In almost all cases the standard font is a better choice. Font size is less of a concern than it was years ago, particularly with improved compression technologies such as woff2.** 

## Previous versions archive

Previous versions remain available from our [Previous versions archive](https://software.sil.org/doulos/download/previous-versions).
