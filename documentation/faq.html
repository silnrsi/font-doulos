    <p>Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions
    specifically regarding Doulos SIL:</p>
    <h4
    id="why-does-the-font-have-some-greek-characters-but-not-all"><em>Why
    does the font have some Greek characters, but not all?</em></h4>
    <p>Although Doulos SIL includes some Greek characters, it is not
    intended to provide general support for the Greek language. The
    Greek characters that are included are there to support various
    notational systems (linguistic, logical, mathematical). Other fonts,
    such as <a href="https://software.sil.org/gentium">Gentium</a>,
    provide complete Greek script support.</p>
    <h4 id="will-you-add-full-greek-script-support"><em>Will you add
    full Greek script support?</em></h4>
    <p>We have no plans to do that. However the <a
    href="https://openfontlicense.org_web">OFL licensing</a> allows
    anyone to add Greek support and freely distribute the font to
    others. It is even possible to <a href="developer.html">contribute
    that work back to the project</a> and share it with others.</p>
    <h4
    id="why-doesnt-doulos-sil-have-a-full-set-of-styles-will-you-add-them-in-the-future"><em>Why
    doesn’t Doulos SIL have a full set of styles? Will you add them in
    the future?</em></h4>
    <p>Our other fonts (Charis, Gentium, and Andika) are much better
    suited for most purposes and contain full sets of styles. Doulos SIL
    is provided for those who need a very basic font in the style of
    Times. We have no plans to add additional styles to Doulos SIL.</p>
    <h4
    id="why-is-version-7-likely-to-be-the-last-major-version-of-doulos-sil"><em>Why
    is version 7 likely to be the last major version of Doulos
    SIL?</em></h4>
    <p>There remain few, if any, uses for which Doulos SIL is a good
    font choice, and we want to focus future efforts into our other
    fonts.</p>
